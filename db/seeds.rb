# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
# Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Download json with movies data
movies_json_url = URI('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlabouardy/Rated-Movies/master/client/data/top-rated.json')

# Delete each movie from database
Movie.delete_all

# Iterate through each of movie
movies.take(200).each do |movie|
  # Extract data about movie
